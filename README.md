"Online Clue Alpha 1.0"

Notes for fixes/improvements:
1.  Room characters need fixing (moving too much causes issues)
2.  Need boxes for normal chat and boxes for game information separate (or more clear)
3.  Need summary of who passed pop up
4.  Need auto click pass boxes on Notes
5.  Need to fix server lag/lock, perhaps game state interval real time check
6.  Fix resizing issues with mouse clicks (code is semi complete, perhaps redraw function)


Notes for upgrades:

1.  Login with username and password feature (Mongo?)
2.  Allow re-connect with username (game state required)
3.  Allow multiple games at once (array of game states?)
4.  Add restart button
5.  JS Minifier
6.  Separate JS into classes/clean up code
7.  Check alternative GameEngine existing libraries
